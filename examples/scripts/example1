%write 'do <path to this file>' in the console to execute the following instruction

%options will return to their previous value after finishing this file
%some options(-v,-s,-c,..) can not be overriden if they were already set to a value (ie by typing '-v=0' in the console)

%verbose console output
-v
%write auxiliary data and optional output to:
-a=./output
%print some statistics
-s
%compare results to STAMINA
-c
%kill SPOT/OINK after [minutes]. ONLY ON LINUX!
-k=15
%set game construction to: transition sequences, check transition order and check W1, both sinks are rejecting
-g=4
%type 'help' in the console for more options

%you can define an automaton in this file using macros

%check the limitedness of the defined cost automaton
lim #1

%optionally, also compare to the expected result: 0 (not limited)
lim #1 0

%check the limitedness of some cost automaton in another file
lim ../CAs/caex

%compute the star height of some DFA
sh ../DFAs/a2

%check some DFA/NFA for the finite power property
fp ../DFAs/a2
