%N0,N1,A0,A1,C0,C1,G,b
%generate G cost automata for every combination of:
%N0<=N<=N1
%A0<=A<=A1
%C0<=C<=C1
%if b==1: compare for every mode
%else: compare the current mode with STAMINA
%G will also be used as the seed for RNG

%in the following tests only compare the following modes

%generates and writes G cost automata, uses G as seed if none is provided
